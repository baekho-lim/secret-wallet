## 🤖 AI-Generated / AI-Assisted Contributions Welcome

This project was built with **Claude Code** assistance. AI-generated contributions are encouraged!

### Guidelines for AI-Coded PRs

If you used AI assistance (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), please:

1. **Mark it in the PR title**
   - Example: `[AI] Add secret rotation feature`
   - Or use tags: `[Claude]`, `[GPT]`, `[Copilot]`

2. **Describe testing coverage**
   - "Tested manually on macOS 14"
   - "Unit tests added (80% coverage)"
   - "Needs integration testing"

3. **Share prompts (optional but helpful)**
   ```
   Example prompt:
   "Implement automatic credential rotation with 90-day expiry.
   Use macOS Keychain metadata to track creation dates."
   ```

4. **Confirm understanding**
   - Review the generated code
   - Ensure it matches security principles (Defense in Depth)
   - Verify no hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities

**Why we welcome AI contributions**:
- Faster iteration on security features

- [ ] Keychain operations use proper ACLs
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) checklist

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md if adding features
- [ ] Add inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md (if applicable)

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new functions
- [ ] Manual testing on macOS 12+ (if available)

## 📝 Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (no behavior change)
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies

**Examples**:
```
feat(keychain): Add biometric authentication for high-security secrets

Implements TouchID/FaceID verification before retrieving secrets
marked with --biometric flag. Uses LocalAuthentication framework
with LAPolicy.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics.

Closes #12
```

```
fix(inject): Prevent credential leakage to parent process

Environment variables are now set only in child process memory.
Parent process (secret-wallet) never has credentials in its env.

Security impact: Mitigates process memory dump attacks.
```

## 🏗️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)
- Swift 5.9+

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baekho-lim/secret-wallet.git
cd secret-wallet
```

**CLI tool:**
```bash
swift build
swift run secret-wallet init
```

**GUI app:**
```bash
cd App
swift build
open .build/debug/SecretWalletApp
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Integration tests (CLI)
./scripts/manual-test.sh

# Manual testing
swift run secret-wallet add test-key
swift run secret-wallet get test-key
swift run secret-wallet remove test-key
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Coverage Target: 80%+

**Required tests**:
- Unit tests for KeychainManager
- Unit tests for MetadataStore
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Edge case tests (empty input, missing keys)

**Optional but encouraged**:
- Security tests (injection attacks, path traversal)
- Performance tests (Keychain latency)
- Biometric simulation tests

---

## 🔒 Security Principles

All contributions must adhere to:

### Defense in Depth
- Never store plaintext credentials
- Use Keychain ACLs (biometric when possible)
- Isolate credentials to child process memory
- Validate all user input

### Threat Model Awareness
- Assume attacker has physical device access
- Assume attacker can dump process memory
- Assume attacker can read filesystem

### Secure Defaults
- Biometric auth recommended (not required)
- Metadata stored separately from secrets
- No logging of credential values
